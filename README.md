# SirionLab-Backend - Supplier Performance: [Website Link](https://supper.netlify.app/)

### [Demo Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FV2tm_gPM0)

### Problem Statement: 
Selecting a supplier from among thousands and doing a predictive performance analysis is a challenge which most of the client's face. Evaluating supplier performance based on multiple attributes would not only help clients mitigate risk but also help reduce costs. 

In order to achieve the same, we have provided some unstructured supplier performance data which may be millions of records, with multi-dimensional attributes from supplier rating, region, cost etc. 

Supplier performance can be defined as follows:

Formula using attributes. For example, Minimize [Cost] + Maximize[Rating] for upcoming year based on the historical data which can be executed within a specific duration [e.g., 30 days] for a specific service [e.g., Application Development] with minimum escalation 

As the expected outcome is meant for the future, all the numerical fields should be based on predictive computation as per historical data for each supplier.
